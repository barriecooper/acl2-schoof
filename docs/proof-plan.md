# Proof plan

This document owns forward mathematical dependency order. Current theorem-level
status is in the [obligation ledger](obligations.md); stable design is in
[architecture](architecture.md).

## Destinations and shared seam

The long-term destinations are a Manin-style proof of Hasse's theorem and an
executable, certified Schoof point-counting algorithm. They share the generic
field, polynomial, curve, finite-cardinality, and Frobenius foundations, but
neither downstream track is a prerequisite for the other.

The Hasse track uses the adopted hybrid representation: canonical symbolic
maps over a narrow rank-two short-Weierstrass function field for equality,
composition, separability, and degree, and a separate geometric point seam for
Frobenius fixedness and the `ker(1-pi)`/degree bridge. The weakest sufficient
point carrier remains to be selected when that bridge is realized.

The Schoof track uses dense ascending univariate division-polynomial data with
the conventional `2y` factor removed from even indices. Its immediate forward
order is:

1. Complete generic/F11 table, sequence, and all-index evaluator
   correspondence. The generic table/sequence/evaluator theory and bounded F11
   base/recurrence transport are already available; concrete execution does not
   replace the remaining semantic correspondence.
2. Add only the quotient-coordinate laws required by the first trace-test
   client.
3. Add Frobenius action and trace-congruence tests over that quotient-coordinate
   interface.
4. Add bounded CRT reconstruction and compose the trace congruences into the
   final point-count correctness theorem and executable Schoof boundary.

Do not introduce generated-table or all-index claims before their explicit
F11 correspondence theorems certify. Cardinality-based Frobenius must use
certified actual cardinality and compatible characteristic/prime-power
metadata, never merely `field-frobenius-exponent`.

## Hasse dependency order

1. Stage the pure discriminant argument behind explicit abstract
   endomorphism/positive-degree premises, without claiming Hasse or treating a
   false context guard as a realization.
2. Build the narrow rank-two symbolic map fragment, beginning with canonical
   map equality and `deg(pi)=q`.
3. Realize the fixed-kernel/base-point and separable-degree bridge over the
   weakest adequate geometric carrier.
4. Instantiate the arithmetic consumer to derive the public Hasse inequality.

## Completion criteria

A phase is complete only when its registered books certify under repository
trust policy and the obligation ledger records its remaining dependencies.
Guard verification and concrete evaluation are execution evidence, not
semantic correspondence. Chronological completion narratives and proof-debug
history belong in commits, pull requests, and explicitly historical audits.
